**Project Overview:**
This is a full-stack project management application. Its goal is to provide a platform where users can manage projects, tasks, and finances.

**Technology Stack:**
*   **Backend:** Python (FastAPI)
*   **Frontend:** Next.js (TypeScript/JavaScript)
*   **Database:** MongoDB

**Work Completed So Far:**

1.  **Basic Structure:**
    *   A monorepo has been set up with separate folders for backend and frontend.
    *   Docker Compose has been configured to easily run the local development environment.

2.  **Backend:**
    *   An API has been developed to handle users, projects, tasks, and financial data.
    *   User authentication and security (with JWT) have been implemented.
    *   WebSocket functionality for real-time updates (like the Kanban board) has been set up.
    *   Models (schemas) and services for the database have been defined.

3.  **Frontend:**
    *   A user interface has been built which includes:
        *   Login and Registration pages.
        *   A central Dashboard.
        *   Pages for managing projects and tasks.
        *   A real-time Kanban board.
        *   Financial sections for tracking income and expenses.
        *   Time-tracking feature.

4.  **Database:**
    *   The project has been set up to use MongoDB, and the initial data structure has been defined.

**Summary:**
The core features for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of a project management tool are largely complete. The development has followed a specific plan, with specifications, plans, and history all recorded.
